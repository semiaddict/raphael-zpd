# Raphaël-ZPD
### A little plugin for the [Raphaël](http://raphaeljs.com/) Javascript SVG library enabling canvas-wide zoom, pan and drag functionality.

## Usage

Create a Raphaël paper object, then call the ZPD initialization function with the systems to enable (before performing any drawing operations):

	paper.ZPD({ zoom: true, pan: true, drag: true });

Repeated calls to this function may be used to alter the settings as needed. You may disable the drag functionality on the basis of individual Raphaël elements like so:

	el.node.draggable = false;

## Potential Issues

The ZPD function works by creating an SVG group element (with id 'viewport') and altering the paper's canvas to point at it, causing all following elements created via the paper to be placed within. This will potentially break any plugins or Raphaël functions that rely on paper.canvas pointing to the root SVG object, though I have yet to encounter such a situation.

## Examples

[Treeblob](http://www.lemma.org/experiments/treeblob/) is a contrived example of network visualisation using the panning and zooming functionalities.
